# 100DaysofCoding-Day17-oopTriviaGame

For this project the goal was to create a trivia game using object oriented programming. The hardest part for me was detaching the usual was of coding i would use and adapting to using classes with different attributes and methods. I was able to create dfifferent classes which were called in the main.py titled Day17OOPClass.py. I am definetly proud of the progress and cannot wait to see how expereinced I come out at the end of things.
